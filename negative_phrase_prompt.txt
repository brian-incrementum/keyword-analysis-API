# Amazon PPC Negative Keywords Generator

Analyze the following Amazon product listing and generate a JSON array of negative keywords that would ACTUALLY appear in customer searches but should be excluded from PPC campaigns.

## Instructions:
Focus ONLY on terms that:
1. Would realistically be searched alongside your product keywords
2. Would trigger your ads but attract the wrong customers
3. Are commonly used modifiers in actual Amazon searches

## Key Categories to Consider:

### 1. Wrong Audience (only if commonly searched)
- Gender terms that appear in searches (women/mens if gender-specific)
- Age terms actually used in searches (kids, baby - only if relevant)

### 2. Wrong Product Variations
- Specific variations you don't offer that customers search for
- Common product modifiers you don't have

### 3. Materials/Features You DON'T Have
- Only materials customers actually search for in your category
- Missing features that are commonly requested

### 4. Competitor Brands
- Only major competitors in your specific category
- Brands customers might search alongside generic terms

### 5. Price/Quality Indicators
- Only include if strongly misaligned with your positioning
- Terms customers actually use when searching

## Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY a JSON array of strings
- Focus on HIGH-PROBABILITY search terms only
- Exclude generic terms that wouldn't appear in real searches
- Keep list concise and relevant

## Example:
For "Men's Black Thermal Underwear Set - Long Sleeve, Medium", return ONLY terms that would actually be searched:
```json
[
  "women",
  "womens",
  "kids",
  "white",
  "grey",

  "heated",
  "electric",
  "top only",
  "bottom only",
  "compression",
  "carhartt",
  "under armour",
